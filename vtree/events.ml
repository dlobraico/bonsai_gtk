(* One [match] over [Kind.t] with no wildcard arm: a kind added without a decision here is
   a compile error, which is the only reason this table can be trusted to be complete.
   [test/live/live_events.ml] is what keeps each arm honest against the widget impl that
   actually connects the signals. *)

(* The controller attrs are legal on every kind: they are not any impl's signal, they are
   a [GtkEventController] the runtime attaches to whatever widget carries the attr. So
   [is_supported] short-circuits on them rather than consulting [for_kind], and no impl
   may declare one in its [Widget_impl.signals] -- [test/live/live_events.ml] asserts
   that, because an impl that did would connect a second handler nobody removes.

   Exhaustive on purpose, like [Attr.Name.is_event]: Task 5's key attrs are controller
   attrs too, and a name added to the wrong branch here would be rejected on every kind
   (or accepted on all of them) with nothing to say why. *)
